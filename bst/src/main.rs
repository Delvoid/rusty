// left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key.
// right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key.
// left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.

// rootnode - topmost node of the tree
// left child - node positioned to the left of a root or node
// right child - node positioned to the right of a root or node
// leaf - node that does not have any child node
